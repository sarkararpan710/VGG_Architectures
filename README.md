# VGG_Architectures
VGG architectures and training on datasets
This is my first try in how to code convolutional architectures from scratch and reading papers. Since I have read and did few courses on 
Deep Learning like the deeplearning Andrew Ng course and the Fast ai course, I have decided to code the most popular architectures from scratch and so I have tried to implement the VGG19 architecture from the original paper. The link to the paper is posted below. 

It was a great learning experience in reading the paper and implementing it the architecture from scratch.
